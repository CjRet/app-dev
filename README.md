# Drive to Survive 2018-2023
> Drive to Survive is a documentary about F1 racing, their drivers and especially the teams which compete for the World Title and Constructors Championship. There are 10 teams in Formula One which consists of 2 drivers per team that adds up to 20 drivers in total. The series focuses on the hardwork of each team on how they can improve their strategies in achieving their main goal which is the World Title. Drama is also part of this documentary because every team has the right to either change their drivers or let them stay depending on their performances each race. Formula One is also a very dangerous sport which makes it very thrilling and at the same time, exciting to watch when you're really rooting for your favorite team to win.
